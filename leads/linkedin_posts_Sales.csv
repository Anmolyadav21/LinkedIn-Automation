"I watched a rep who had waited months to get a 400-pound cart for a demo.

He hauled it to his prospect, only for them to say, “It’s nice, but it’s out of our price range” before we even got started.

That’s when I realized something most sales teams don’t talk about:

Most of your sales cycle is a lie.

And a big portion of your effort? Wasted on actions that aren’t really needed to close the deal.

Demo scheduling, chasing forms, endless email chains, internal checklists.

Is every step necessary? I found a better way.

I never did a single demo for that product line and I outsold expectations year after year with a pipeline bursting at the seams.

What changed?

A $25 tape measure and the confidence to ask better questions.

If your deals are dragging this story might hit home.

"“Sell value, not price!” is a mantra in sales, but do we even agree on what value means? I’m not so sure...

Too often, we confuse value with product features, lower price, or cool tech. But in complex B2B sales, none of that matters if it doesn't deliver the customer’s desired outcome.

In this week’s newsletter, I unpack why your idea of value might be hurting your sales, and what to do instead. It’s time we stop selling what we think is valuable and start discovering what actually is.

What’s your take? How do you define value in your sales conversations?",N/A

"In senior living sales, objections aren’t barriers—they are the sales process itself. 

This article redefines what it means to be a relationship-based sales professional, emphasizing empathy, trust-building, and communication over transactional tactics.

With decision timelines often stretching over months, professionals must stay present and genuinely engaged with families navigating emotional and practical concerns. By listening actively, anticipating objections, and offering tailored, compassionate solutions, sales professionals can guide Prospects with confidence and care.

The article outlines key strategies—such as using social proof, building long-term rapport, and leveraging a network of experts—to address hesitation and turn uncertainty into clarity.

It reinforces that objections are not rejection, but signals of readiness being shaped.

Through a personalized, human-first approach, sales professionals become true partners in the journey toward a move, offering both insight and reassurance.

For anyone working in senior living sales, this is a reminder: your role is vital, your professionalism matters, and your persistence—when rooted in empathy—is powerful.",N/A
